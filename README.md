# THESE FILES WERE SHARED BY A FAN. WE CANNOT SHARE THE NAME WHO GAVE IT TO US.
You can set any amout of craws from 1 to 90. **VERY** higher numbers are NOT allowed. 

You can add anything you want in the ``const crawls`` line, starting with a ``'`` and ending with a ``',`` at the end of the craw. Here is example:
```
'This is a Test',
```

No ' at any craw feld, like this:
```
'This i's a test',
```
This wil cause a syntax error causing the script to fail.

If you want to add a block, add a ``#`` and type anything uppercase like:

```
'#THIS IS A TEST',
```

Open the ``.html`` file in a fast graphics card computer for the best experience.
